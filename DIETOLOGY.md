------------

 * Law of Food Supply - a basis of biological life: material resource supplement of an individual genetic plan of grows - the only way to grow healthy human
 * Law of Natural selection - the one who did not adapt to an environment not survive or not able to leave viable offsprings. (applied to food supply)
 * 80% of the population starving - deprived of adequate nutrition
 * 40% infertile(mostly connected to disgusting food habits)
 * taste - way to find required food supply. Highly important to taste the big variety of food and follow developed food sense.

Proteins:
 * Functions(priority order): 
   1. structure
   2. transport (albumins, lipoprotein/cholesterol)
   3. immune (globulins)
   4. fermentation (protease, lipase, amylase)
   5. hereditary (DNA)
 * Sources(importance order):
   1. milk and milk derivatives
   2. animal protein (locomotion)
   3. plant protein: (top: lentils, soya bean, bean)
 * Aminoacids in proteins:
   1. milk - all 20 amino acids
   2. animal - all 20 amino acids (but most % for muscles)
   3. plant - only 8 amino acids
 * Dietary supplement:
   * fish oil. more better, no limits
   * lecithin (phosphatidylcholine). more better, no limits
   * essential oil (adding to food). each has own function

 * more proteins - better
 * albumins do not survive in more than 42 degree Celsius
 * fermentation(enzyme) deficiency - most popular deficit of proteins, but easy to correct
 * receptor imprinting - calibration of teste happening during first food experience
 * milk - one of greatest mechanisms adaptation in nature
 * eating more similar structures(of animals) required to build similar structures in our body. so eating different internals alike liver, heart and even brains(fish head) is good
 * it is required to have all 20 amino acids for the healthy body
 * all people differ in a requirement of specific amino acids. this means every family member should have own diet and find food himself(so buying food/cooking by one family member may be not perfect only because amino acid requirements may be different)
 * ideal protein - egg white

Fats:
 * Functions(priority order)
   1. Breathing (surfactant)
   2. Cell membrane
   3. Hormones
   4. Heat production

 * Sources(importance order):
   1. animal fats: egg, caviar, internal organ fats, butter
   2. plant fats: olive oil, grape oil, linseed oil, cedar oil 

 * fat is important in exchange of O2 and CO2 in lungs. fats cover alveoli 
 * alveoli is most vulnerable to pollution/infections in breathing system. no natural way of cleaning up. cleaning up alveoli can be done with halogenerator
 * Top O2 consumers: muscles, neurons, feeding
 * with good oxygen level(aerobic glycolysis): glucose + O2 => 36 ATP(energy battery) + CO2 + H20. 
 * without oxygen level(anaerobic glycolysis) other reaction: glucose -> 6ATP + 30 lactic acid (6 times less energy + toxic acid)
 * fat(cell membrane) covers protein. cell membrane dielectric and generates a potential difference between outer side and the inner side(electric energy).
 * hormones are generated from fats
 * from childhood till puberty all feeding is directed towards growth. this is controlled by steroid hormones. switching to puberty turns on steroids and stops growth.
 * fats burn very slow and generating heat
 * body temperature below 36.4C degree means deficiency of fats
 * animal fats best for surfactant and cell membrane building
 * plant fats are reactogenic. unsaturated fats good for many different reactions by saturating with required molecules 
 * ideal fat - egg yolk, caviar
 * main plant fat food rule is a diversity of many plant oils. at least 5 oils, at least 6 tablespoons per day.
 * oil storage rules: no oxygen, no sunlight
 * second health food rule: fat requirement raises with latitude and altitude up to 80%
 * refined oil better for frying(high temperature), non-refined for everything else

Carbohydrates:
 * only function - food energy for physical activity 
 * should be delivered to muscles
 * Two types of carbs
   * Fast carbs:
     * sugar
     * everything containing sugar
     * potato starch / potato
     * grape / sweet wine / raisins
     * banana
     * white rice
     * semolina
     * white wheat flour (and produced from it)
   * Slow carbs:
     * pearl barley 
     * oats
     * corn
     * millet
     * buckwheat
     * barley
     * millet
     * other than grape and banna berries and fruits (Fruktose)
     * all dried fruits except raisins (Fruktose)
     * all non-rafinated sugar
     * all diabetic/dietic sugars
     * saccharin
     * honey(if sugar syrop is consumed by bee it's not slow)
 * Glucose - main component
 * Glucose + Glucose = Sucrose (sugar, fast)
 * Glucose + Galaktose = Fruktose (slow)
 * Lactose (slow)
 * fast carbs: peaks 9 mmol/L during 15 minutes and goes to 0 right after
 * glycogen(emergency carbs) stored in muscles is enough for 15 minutes
 * slow carbs: goes to 5.5 during 2 hours and keeps till 6 hours at that level, then goes down.
 * norms: 3.5 - 5.5 mmol/L (raised to 5.8, then 6.0, 6.2, 6.5)
 * person without much physical activity fast carbs are contraindicated
 * there is no symptoms of hyperglycemia (> 5.8 mmol/L)
 * symptoms of hypoglycemia (< 3.5 mmol/L): panic(3.8 mmol/L), emergency glycogen(3.5 mmol/L, during 15 mins: fatigue, sweat, loss of consciousness, heart stop and death)
 * ways to detect sugar level:
   * fasting sugar (7-8 in the morning, don't drink, don't eat)
   * sugar with load
   * glycated hemoglobin (>7 sugar diabetes)
 * 1% of physical activity is brain requirement
 * fast carb required to consume before physical load
 * brain activity require slow carbs
 * diabetes make all internal organs glycated
 * excess of glucose is converted carbohydrate fat
 * economically fast carbs are a lot cheaper and simpler to produce
 * excluding fast carbs is great for health
